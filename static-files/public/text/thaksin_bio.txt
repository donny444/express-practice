Thaksin Shinawatra is a prominent Thai politician, entrepreneur, and former Prime Minister of Thailand. Born on July 26, 1949, in Chiang Mai, Thailand, he played a significant role in Thai politics in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. His biography includes the following key points:

Early Life and Education: Thaksin came from a modest background. He studied at the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School and later joined the Royal Thai Police, where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He pursued further education in criminal justice in the United States, earning a master's degree from Eastern Kentucky University and a doctorate from Sam Houston State University.

Business Ventures: After leaving the police force, Thaksin entered the private sector and became a successful entrepreneur. He founded the Shinawatra Company, which focused on telecommunications and other business ventures. His telecom company, Advanced Info Service (AIS), became one of the largest in Thailand.

Political Career: Thaksin entered politics and founded the Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) Party in 1998. He campaigned on a platform of economic populism, promising to address poverty and boost economic growth. His party won the 2001 general elections by a large margin, and he became the Prime Minister of Thailand.

Prime Ministerial Tenure: Thaksin's leadership style was marked by a strong emphasis on economic policies and social welfare programs. He implemented policies such as the "30-Baht Health Care Scheme" and rural development initiatives. His government, however, faced controversies related to human rights issues and alleged abuse of power.

Ongoing Controversies: Thaksin's popularity declined due to allegations of corruption, conflicts of interest, and abuse of power. He faced accusations of suppressing media freedom and democratic institutions. His handling of the Southern Thailand insurgency also drew criticism.

2006 Coup and Exile: Amidst growing political tensions and mass protests, Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 while he was attending the United Nations General Assembly. He went into self-imposed exile to avoid legal charges in Thailand.

Political Influence: Despite his exile, Thaksin remained influential in Thai politics through his supporters and affiliated parties. His supporters, known as the "Red Shirts," engaged in political demonstrations in his favor.

Legal Issues and Return: Thaksin faced various legal challenges and was convicted in absentia for corruption-related charges. He returned to Thailand in 2008 but was sentenced to prison. He left the country again to avoid serving his sentence.

Continued Impact: Thaksin's influence continued to shape Thai politics even after he left the country. His political legacy remained divisive, with fervent supporters and strong opponents.

Present Status: As of my last update in September 2021, Thaksin remains a controversial and influential figure in Thai politics, despite living in exile. His legacy continues to impact the country's political landscape.
